## Part 2/3

1. The bug was that the two numbers were being processed as strings, therefore the calculateSum function was simply concatenating the two strings. 
2. To fix the bug, I would set the type for both numbers before adding them. I would also seperate the print and calculateSum function call. See expand/screenshots for how i would implement it.
